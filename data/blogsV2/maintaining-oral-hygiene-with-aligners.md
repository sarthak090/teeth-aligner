Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is crucial when wearing clear aligners. While these modern orthodontic devices make it easier to clean your teeth compared to traditional braces, they require specific care routines to ensure optimal results and prevent dental issues.

## Daily Cleaning Routine

### For Your Teeth
1. **Brush After Every Meal**: Remove your aligners and brush your teeth thoroughly before putting them back in.
2. **Floss Daily**: Use dental floss or interdental brushes to remove food particles between teeth.
3. **Use Fluoride Toothpaste**: This helps strengthen your enamel and prevent cavities.

### For Your Aligners
1. **Clean After Removal**: Rinse your aligners with lukewarm water every time you take them out.
2. **Brush Gently**: Use a soft toothbrush and clear, antibacterial soap to clean your aligners.
3. **Soak Regularly**: Use aligner cleaning crystals or tablets as recommended by your orthodontist.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Eating with Aligners**: Always remove your aligners before eating to prevent damage and staining.
2. **Drinking Colored Beverages**: Remove aligners before consuming coffee, tea, or colored drinks.
3. **Using Hot Water**: Never clean aligners with hot water as it can warp the plastic.
4. **Skipping Regular Cleanings**: Maintain your routine dental check-ups during treatment.

## Tips for Travel and Special Occasions

1. **Carry a Cleaning Kit**: Always have a travel toothbrush, toothpaste, and aligner case with you.
2. **Plan Ahead**: When dining out, find a private place to clean your teeth and aligners.
3. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to maintain saliva flow and prevent dry mouth.
